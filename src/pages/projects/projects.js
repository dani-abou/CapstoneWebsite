    musicalNotes: `Over the years, cassettes became a representation of punk rock. Maybe it’s because of
the intrinsic distortion they can cause, but maybe (and probably) because of their overlapping
eras of popularity. Punk, though, truly is just a mindset. Breaking your sense of logic, without
rhyme or reason, that’s punk. Let’s double down on punkness. Fuck being punk. How about we
be so punk we destroy one of those cassettes, a tangible representation of the culture?
Now, if you consider music a sonic representation of an environment, how can we
physically change one’s perception with just sonic manipulation? \n\tLet’s take it a step further, how
about we tangibly destroy sounds to overload one’s sense of time? These questions of identity
and reality became prevalent in the song-making process; eccentric punk and the scientific,
logic-driven mindsets came together to create a piece, sounding unlike either of those
descriptions. Our composition was then created by a series of somewhat random manipulations
destructively applied to cassettes with magnets.`,
    demoNotes: `Some groups are only showing a demo, some are only showing music, some are showing both. That's why I am structuring it like this to account for al options. I'm also just rambling to fill in this dummy space. We don't have a demo`

    description: "The AxeTron is an electric guitar designed with portability and live performance at the forefront, with a focus on novel control surfaces and tone capabilities. It is an all-in-one package that gives guitarists access to their entire arsenal, without requiring them to carry around all of their gear. Each effect can be controlled individually with knobs, buttons, and touchpads on the guitar itself. Additionally, players can switch between different presets, which can be customized by the player. The AxeTron also supports advanced functions, such as looping and a drum machine, and contains a built-in theremin for even more tone variety. Users who are experienced with programming can also upload their own firmware to the AxeTron for absolute control over its functionality.",

    description: "For my capstone project, I have decided to compose an original orchestral piece using sample libraries and incorporating audio recordings of real musicians. Drawing inspiration from my favorite composer, Yu Peng Chen, I aimed to create a composition that could serve as background music in a video game. To achieve this, I transcribed and analyzed his compositions, such as 'Stories of Remote Antiquity', and combined some of his techniques with my own during the composing process. During the production process, I utilized the BBC Symphony orchestras and Appassionata Strings to lay the foundation of the song. To enhance the track with virtuosic performances, I hired a professional violinist friend and recorded him at the recording studio at Snell. His contribution added a layer of authenticity to the piece and made it stand out. Overall, this project has allowed me to combine my passion for orchestral programming and audio engineering to create a composition that I am proud of.",

    description: "DeepDeadNet is a web application built with Python and Django, and leverages the Musika and Demucs libraries. It allows users to generate new music in the style of the Grateful Dead, and isolate or mix each instrument to their preference. The goal of the project is to provide an accessible graphical user interface to people who are interested in AI music generation, but are unfamiliar with command-line interfaces. Additionally, this project combines multiple neural networks into a single workflow, in order to demonstrate that they can be applied in tandem for a practical use case. Broadly, this project aims to explore the current potential of music generation through cutting-edge techniques in artificial intelligence.",

    description: "This project combines music production with music and the brain research. The goal of the project is to replicate an already established research study under new and modified conditions. The research study that is being replicated looks at how added amplitude modulation in music can influence sustained attention.1 Amplitude modulation can be defined as a modulation technique that creates variation in the amplitude of a carrier signal. In the case of this experiment, amplitude modulation at 16 hertz is being used as a way to manipulate the sound of music, as well as affect performance on cognitive tasks. As someone who loves to meditate and study with music, Ayla has created her own ambient piece tuned to 432 Hz, which is scientifically shown to increase relaxation and focus. There are two ambient pieces being presented in this experiment: one with added amplitude modulation and another without, both of which are tested on participants in order to yield quantitative data.",

    description: "ABSOLUTE is a rhythm game/RPG hybrid with player-choice driven gameplay mechanics & dynamic music which changes based on those choices. It's developed in the Unity Engine with WWISE integration to handle our adaptive audio. The game features overworld segments where the player can explore and rhythm game segments framed as boss battles. As a result our background research involved two different aspects, related titles’ gameplay mechanics and the usage of generative and adaptive music in other games, rhythm or otherwise. Through our research we’ve further developed the gameplay and audio mechanics of our own rhythm game on a larger scale, and our own method for adaptive music and song design. Our song design uses horizontal restructuring and vertical layering to emphasize player-choice through audio. The resulting song of the game is a culmination of segmented song sections in which the timbre, emotion, and rhythm based off of the player’s aggressive or passive choices throughout the levels.",

    description: "Songwriter’s Notebook is a mobile application designed for songwriters to track their musical ideas and inspirations. Designed by a songwriter with a personal vendetta against existing songwriting apps, the app supports the flexibility and creativity that is needed by songwriters across genres and musical styles. In one convenient application, songwriters can store lyrics, melodies, harmonies, chord progressions, audio recordings, photos, videos, and links to other songs to use as samples or inspiration. Special attention was given to designing an intuitive interface that allows users to get their ideas down quickly and easily. This capstone project focused on designing the UI and creating the technical specifications for the application. Post-graduation, Morgan will be continuing to work on the app’s implementation and development.",

    members: ["Wilson Dobbs"],
    description: "This paper concerns the construction of a four-part microphone amplifier. The goal of the project is to explore the design process of a quality pre-amplifier and to craft a musically-interesting tool. First, the power supply steps down the wall AC voltage to DC, creating sources for all op-amps including phantom power. Second, the pre-amplifier gains dynamic or condenser microphones in two stages. Third, the line-level signal passes through a parametric equalizer. Last, the signal passes through a saturation unit and can be equalized again. The intention is that the tone produced by the equalizer- sandwiched saturator is shapeable. The samples can be fed into an ADC on a Daisy Seed microcontroller. The total parameters of the prototype are evaluated and its musical functions are observed. Then, design constraints, challenges, and modifications are considered. Lastly, the anticipated future upgrades are discussed.",
